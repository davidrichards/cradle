Cradle
======

This is the beginning of it all, an application that can manage 
people, events, projects and publications.  It is meant to have
a limited domain, but unlimited uses.  Basically, I want to have
a central data repository where I can demonstrate all things data:

* Big Data or Small Data
* Predictive Analytics
* Data Visualization
* Collection Methods
* Statistics
* NoSQL, Relational or Semantic Data Bases
* Data Reification

At first, I made fun of [Uncle Bob's keynote at Midwest](http://bit.ly/Q4zLlN).
I decided I'd try his ideas out before I went public, marking him as a 
fanatic.  Well, I tried the ideas out, to the best of my understanding,
and I actually like what he showed us.  I'm shocked.  More importantly,
I have a massively-configurable application that can help me keep
my data demonstrations focused.
